# Bionic Hand Project

The Bionic Hand Project uses the Pololu Romi 32U4 Reference Robot for WPILib WebSocket Interface.  This has been modified to run this projects.  Here's a list of modifications:

- Added second _i2cHandle to communication with second Arduino.

## Electrical Design
- Two Arduino Nanos.

<!-- Uses the [A-Star 32U4 Robot Controller with Raspberry Pi Bridge LV](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J66). Here's the [Pinout](https://www.pololu.com/docs/0J66/3.9).   -->

- [Micro Metal Gearmotors](https://www.pololu.com/category/60/micro-metal-gearmotors).  Most of these were bought from Amazon at a lower price.

- [DRV8835 Dual Motor Driver Carrier](https://www.pololu.com/product/2135)

- [Bourn's SENSOR ROTARY 330DEG PC PIN](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/bourns-inc/3382H-1-103/2080233)


## **Install on Raspberry Pi**

Install tsc:

    npm install tsc

Rebuild the application by running:

    cd wpilib-ws-robot-romi
    npm run-script build-js

This creates a new package in `dist`.    

Packages need to be redeployed in `/home/pi/.nvm/versions/node/v14.15.0/lib/node_modules/@wpilib/wpilib-ws-robot-romi/dist` so copy the `dist` package:   

    cp -r dist ~/.nvm/versions/node/v14.15.0/lib/node_modules/@wpilib/wpilib-ws-robot-romi

Restart the server:
    ps -ef|grep node
    sudo kill -2 PID

The `package-lock.json` file may have changed so you can discard the changes from git:

    git reset --hard

## Regenerating the Shared Memory File

The source file is sharedmem.json in the home directory.  Running the following command will regenerate the scripts `romi-shmem-buffer.js` and `firmware/shmem_buffer.h`.  The generation script is `generate-buffer.js`.

    npm run-script gen-shmem

## **Introduction**
This repository contains a reference implementation of a robot that can be controlled via the WPILib HALSim WebSocket extensions. The chassis and controller are based around the [Romi robot](https://www.pololu.com/category/202/romi-chassis-and-accessories) and associated [Control Board](https://www.pololu.com/product/3544) from Pololu.

## **Usage with WPILib**
For usage with WPILib, please take a look at the [WPILib Romi documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html). It has more information on how to install the WPILibPi Raspberry Pi image, which comes packaged with the software needed to image your Romi robot, and provides useful status information.

## **Software Dependencies**
NEW: Please use the 2021 WPILib installer ([Beta 4](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2021.1.1-beta-4) or later) to install the necessary development software for use with the Romi.

## **Raspbery Pi Installation**
NEW: For the latest information on how to image your Raspberry Pi for use with the Romi, please see the [WPILib Romi documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html).

## **Controlling The Robot via WPILib**
NEW: For the latest information on how to use WPILib with the Romi, please see the [WPILib Romi documentation](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/romi-robot/index.html).

In your robot project, Hit `F5` or run `Simulate Robot Code on Desktop` from the VSCode Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`).

![](resources/vscode-palette-simulate.png)

Once your code compiles, a new selection dialog will appear. This lists all the extensions you had listed under `dependencies` in your `build.gradle` file. Select the `halsim_ds_socket.[so/dylib/dll]` and `halsim_ws_client.[so/dylib/dll]` options (file extension depends on your OS).

![](resources/vscode-select-extension.png)

Upon clicking `OK`, your robot project should start running on the desktop, and you should something similar to the image below in your console:

![](resources/halsim-extension-start.png)

If you see the line `WebSocket Connected`, you have established a connection to your robot! From this point, your WPILib-based robot code will trigger corresponding behaviors on the Romi (e.g. if you output `HIGH` on `DigitalOutput` channel 3, the yellow LED on the Romi will turn on). For more information about the pin mappings and assignments, see the [firmware README](firmware/README.md).

## **Theory of Operation**
This section provides more technical details on how this package works.

### **Communication Between Raspberry Pi and Romi 32U4 Board**
The Raspberry Pi and Romi 32U4 boards are connected via the 40-pin connector, and communicate over I2C. The Romi firmware uses the [Pololu Raspberry Pi interface library for Arduino](https://github.com/pololu/pololu-rpi-slave-arduino-library) to facilitate board-to-board communication.

Both boards essentially utilize a "shared memory buffer" to read/write to. The layout of this buffer can be found in the `sharedmem.json` file. Since both the firmware and JS code need to have the same buffer layout, the `generate-buffer.js` script reads in the `sharedmem.json` file and automatically generates a `shmem_buffer.h` file for the firmware and a `romi-shmem-buffer.ts` file for the Node application, thus keeping both sets of files in sync.

### **Application Structure**
The main entry point for the application is `src/index.ts`. The file is fairly small and serves as a binding layer for the `WPILibWSRomiRobot` class (which is defined in `src/romi-robot.ts`) and the `WPILibWSRobotEndpoint` class (which is defined in the [wpilib-ws-robot](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/wpilib-ws-robot) NPM package).

The `wpilib-ws-robot` package provides a wrapper around the guts of the WPILib WebSocket protocol, and allows developers to easily interface with other kinds of robots, simply by extending from the `WPILibWSRobotBase` class (also exposed by `wpilib-ws-robot`).

In the `src/romi-robot.ts` file, you can see how the defined class interacts with the Romi firmware over I2C.

The `src/i2c` folder contains both an I2C abstraction layer, and concrete implementations of a Raspberry Pi compatible I2C bus (`src/i2c/hw-i2c.ts`) and a mock I2C bus (`src/i2c/mock-i2c.ts`) that can be used for testing on non-Raspberry Pi platforms.

### **`wpilib-ws-robot` and `node-wpilib-ws` Packages**
This application depends on the `wpilib-ws-robot` package (as mentioned above), which in turn depends on `node-wpilib-ws`. The `node-wpilib-ws` package contains the core classes that implement the WPILib WebSocket protocol, and the code can be found at its [repository](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/node-wpilib-ws).

See the READMEs in each of the dependent packages to find out more about how to use them outside of this application.
